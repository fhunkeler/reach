# Installation

## from CDN

The fastest way to get started is to serve JavaScript from [jsdelivr][JSDELIVR] or [unpkg][UNPKG]:

```html
<!-- The Flexible DataSync library -->
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://unpkg.com/webcom/webcom'></script>
<!-- The Reach Library -->
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://unpkg.com/webcom-reach'></script>
<!-- OR -->
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/webcom-reach/latest/reach.js'></script>
```

## Using your favorite package manager

### [npm][NPM]

```bash
npm i --save webcom-reach
```

### [yarn][YARN]

```bash
yarn add webcom-reach
```

Then just import Reach within your code :

```javascript
import Reach from 'webcom-reach';
```
